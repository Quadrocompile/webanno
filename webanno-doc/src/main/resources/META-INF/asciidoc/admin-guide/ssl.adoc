= Securing WebAnno with SSL

This section assumes Debian 9.1 (Stretch) as the operating system using link:https://www.nginx.com/[NGINX] as a web server with WebAnno running through a separate Tomcat instance.
It further assumes that you want to use link:https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt] as a CA for obtaining valid SSL
certificates.

* In addition, you will need a fully registered domain name. This tutorial uses `example.com`. Replace it accordingly.

NOTE: We strongly encourage securing your production system with a firewall like UFW.
