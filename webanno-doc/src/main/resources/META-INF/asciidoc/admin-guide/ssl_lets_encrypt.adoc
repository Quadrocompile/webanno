= Obtaining a Let's Encrypt certificate

The Certification Authority (CA) _Let's Encrypt_ provides free TLS/SSL certificates. These certificates allow for secure HTTPS connections on web servers. _Let's Encrypt_ provides the software Certbot which automates the obtaining process for NGINX.

* link:https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/[Enable the Stretch backports repo] if needed

* Install Certbot preconfigured for NGINX

----
$ apt-get install python-certbot-nginx -t stretch-backports
----

* Obtain the certificates for your domain `example.com`
----
$ certbot --nginx certonly -d example.com
----

* You will be prompted to enter your e-mail address and asked to agree to the terms of service. Certificate renewal information will be sent to this e-mail. If the certification process is successful it will yield the information where your certificates can be found.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem. Your cert will
   expire on 2019-04-22. To obtain a new or tweaked version of this
   certificate in the future, simply run certbot again with the
   "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of your
   certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

NOTE: Certificates issued by _Let's Encrypt_ are valid for 90 days. You will receive an expiry notification to the e-mail address you provided during the certification process.

* Run Certbot with the command `renew` to renew all certificates that are due. You can also create a cron job for this purpose. The command for renewal is
----
$ certbot --nginx renew
----

* You can simulate the certificate renewal process with the command
----
$ certbot --nginx renew --dry-run
----

* The directory `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/` now contains the necessary certificates to proceed
----
$ ls /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com
Output:
cert.pem  chain.pem  fullchain.pem  privkey.pem
